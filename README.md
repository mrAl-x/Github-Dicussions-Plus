# Github Discussions +
This is a Chrome extension that aims to helps finding discussions on Github Pull Requests reducing the hassle of scrolling back and forth to find that specific discussion you're looking for by complimentary UI to ease the navigation.

This is currently only being displayed in the "PR Files View" mode of Github.

Note this is an alpha release so bugs are bound to happen and more features/UI will be implemented in the future.

If you can't find the UI try refreshing the files view page
